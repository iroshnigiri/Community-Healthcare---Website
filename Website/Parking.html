    <h2>
        Parking at hospitals</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Parking in a hospital area</li>
        <p>The parking system ensures the regulation of entries to and exits from the hospital area and the collection of parking fees in the hospital car park. The parking system allows the operator to select out of many tariffs or to allocate the authorization to enter to individual users (clients, employees, suppliers, etc.).

            Individual entry and exit terminals operate automatic barriers in compliance with the system setting. The number of controlled devices is not limited. Further, the GPT entry terminals dispense parking cards with a bar code printed on for short-term parking purposes (patients, suppliers or other services, etc.). For long-term parking, the system can be additionally equipped with contactless cards that are used by long-term parking drivers (usually the hospital employees). The exit terminals are equipped with bar code readers that are used for the verification of short-term parking cards. Long-term parking drivers use the contactless card reader that the parking system is equipped with. In case of emergency vehicles passages, both the entry and exit barrier can be opened via remote control or from the security guard office. In order to increase the security of traffic, the placing of semaphores on the automatic barriers is recommended.
            
            The automatic pay station /s is/are located in the hospital area. The automatic pay station is designed for the collection of payments for the parking services that have been used. The automatic pay station can accept coins and banknotes while any surplus would be returned either in coins or in banknotes (for an additional charge). In the automatic pay station, the payment by a credit card can also be made (this option is conditioned by the additional installation of necessary components into the station, the connection to the internet and the conclusion of a contract with a bank). The automatic pay station features the "lost ticket" function and the "planned event" function. The system also allows payments to be made at the attending staff via the manual pay station.The system server is usually located at the gatehouse or at the reception - here, at the manual pay station and the attending staff, parking fees can be paid and card of some visitors (e.g. the disabled) can be validated. The car park administration can be executed at the same place. (It is also possible to purchase a software licence and, after the connection of the server to the network has been made, to execute the administration from another computer). The system is capable of sending SMS on the status of individual devices to mobile phones of employees who are in charge of this task. Subsequently, they can control the system on the basis of encoded SMS. Further, the server allows the remote control of a car park or the provision of servicing via the internet or telephone.</p>

        <li>The access system providing the access to the hospital area for authorized persons</li>
        <p>The Access system is used for the monitoring of passages to a building. At the entry, contactless media readers are placed.  The entry is allowed only to media holders (usually the holders of a card or a chip) with valid authorization. In the system database, each medium is allocated an authorization range for the passage through individual entries or the entry to specific zones. The entry can be limited also by a time span (e.g. Tuesday 11:30 â€“ 12:30) which can be used  for supply workers and others.</p>

        <hr>
        <li>The Collection of Regulatory Fees</li>
        <p>The Collection of Regulatory Fees at healthcare facilities is arranged by an unattended automatic pay station, GPM H. The automatic pay station features simple intuitive control, a well-arranged front panel and information touch display with two push buttons. The automatic pay station accepts both coins and banknotes while it returns only coins. After a payment has been made, it prints a receipt. Further, the automatic pay station is capable of creating simple statistics on performed activities.</p>
