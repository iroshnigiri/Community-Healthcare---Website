    <h2>Importance of Great Customer Service in Healthcare and How to Provide it</h2>

    <p>Healthcare is a customer service industry. Companies (and customers) live or die based on the quality of care provided and the daily interactions between staff and patients. The first key to providing great customer service in the healthcare industry is to stop treating patients as customers whose sole purpose is to generate revenue. Great customer service starts with taking a patient-centric perspective – viewing them as people your company is meant to help.

        Every employee in a healthcare company is potentially a customer service representative – someone whose daily activities should be focused on improving the quality of care provided to patients. Some employees will interact with patients directly while others work in supporting roles (behind the scenes), but everyone should approach his or her job with a customer-service mindset.</p>

        <ul>
        <li>Why Customer Service is Important to Healthcare Companies<br>
            Customer service experiences set the expectation for the quality of care</li>
        <p>You may have the most skilled physicians and experienced nurses in the industry, but if you can’t provide a consistently high-quality experience for your patients, they won’t recognize you for outstanding healthcare. The goal of healthcare companies should be to develop long-term relationships with patients rather than approaching each interaction as if it was a transaction.</p>
         
            <hr>
        <li>Happy patients are likely to return to the same doctors, clinics and facilities for all their healthcare needs</li>
        <p>Happy patients are also highly likely to recommend healthcare companies to friends, family members and co-workers. Doctor-patient relationships may not be easily and/or often recognized, but they are some of the best examples of customer loyalty in any industry and the strongest doctor-patient relationships start with customer service. The reputation your company develops for excellent or poor customer service will be critical in determining whether potential patents seek your services in the future.</p>

        <hr>
        <li>Bad data can lead to life-threatening mistakes</li>
        <p>The healthcare industry depends heavily on accurate patient data to make diagnostic and treatment recommendations. Errors, incomplete records and staff’s inability to access needed data can severely impact the quality of care – even potentially leading to life-threatening mistakes and malpractice lawsuits. Customer service systems and processes, and the thoroughness of staff, are the first defense against costly mistakes.</p>

        <hr>
        <li>Poor customer service is an indicator of bigger problems</li>
        <p>Customer service performance is often a symptom and indicator of underlying issues within an organization. A company that provides excellent customer service is likely to have robust and refined processes and systems. Companies that provide poor customer service are likely to struggle with process inefficiencies, staff training and data quality. These don’t just impact patient care, they also impact the cost of operations.</p>
   
        <hr>
       <li>Why Customer Service is Important to Patients</li>   
       <p>Customers don’t seek healthcare services when they are feeling well. They typically engage with healthcare companies and individual providers to seek help for themselves (as the patient), a friend or a family member. Health issues can be stressful. Patients are often worried about their health conditions as well as financial issues and this can strain interactions with customer service staff.

        When engaging with healthcare companies, patients expect more than treatment – they want care. More importantly, patients want healthcare companies and their employees to show they care about the individual’s needs, situation and well-being, which is demonstrated during every interaction.</p>

       <hr>
       <li>Improving the End-to-end Customer Experience</li>   
       <p>Customer service in healthcare is more than the time the patient spends interacting with the provider. The end-to-end customer experience includes many touch points and interactions between the customer and the healthcare company. Each of these interactions provides an opportunity for the company to influence the customer’s perception about the quality and value of care he or she is receiving. The following section is an overview of the key touch points in the healthcare customer experience and what you can do to improve them.</p>

       <hr>
       <li>Selecting Healthcare Products and Services</li>   
       <p>Searching and selecting the products and services the patient needs is the first touchpoint in the customer experience. Many customers will compare reviews, advertisements, referrals from other providers and recommendations from family and friends to determine their healthcare options and find the right products and services for them.  

        A healthcare company’s marketing materials, reputation and relationships with other providers are the key factors that influence potential customers’ first-impressions. Marketing materials, advertising, magazine articles and promotional materials can be effective tools in your overall customer service strategy – helping you target the potential customers.</p>
